# Welcome to Image Share!

Who needs S3, Dropbox, DigitalOcean, etc?!?!?  Image Share is the future!!  Probably not, but it was a fun project to build.

#### How to run
1.  Make sure you have Docker installed
2.  You may have to update the DockerCompose [file](https://github.com/nazevedo3/image_share/blob/a1e7bdff42820945962f9e0c702fb20860e53529/docker-compose.yml#L22)
    That needs to be set to the path on your local machine
3.  Run `docker-compose up --build`
4.  Upload ALL your images!!

## How it's built
Technologies/Languages Used:
